Analysis on the pull oracle, Switchboard

Switchboard is a permissionless, multi-chain oracle network designed to securely bring off-chain data and computation on-chain for smart contracts. Dubbed the “Everything Oracle,” it offers high-performance, customizable data feeds and verifiable randomness using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Switchboard has powered billions in on-chain value and supports thousands of price and data feeds across 10+ blockchains.

Developers can either use existing feeds or create new ones instantly (no API keys or permissions required). Built-in aggregation lets any feed draw from multiple sources – including Chainlink, Pyth, and exchange APIs – to ensure the best pricing and redundancy. In addition, Switchboard provides provably fair randomness via TEEs, enabling transparent games, lotteries, and prediction markets.
